Repeat and RepeatCount___________________
	Printing out RepeatCount
		doesnt work well with containers
		should be used in a lazily-evaluated attribute

Unrecognized stuff_________________
	AllowUnknownAttributes="true"
    AllowUnknownTags="TRUE"
	use <![CDATA[my escaped text]]>
	use &amp; to output & (so to output "&amp", type "&amp;amp;")

Comments________________
	<!--out: will be outputed -->

CDATA___________________
	Quic is XML compliant, so to use scripts, put them in <![CDATA[ ... ]]>
	If CDATA is not sufficient (most probably bcuz u need to include "]]>"), use a comment <!--cdata: ... -->

Model/Data Binding_________
	Not yet supported
