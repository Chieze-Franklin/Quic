# Quic
Quic is a web development framework that enables you create rich web applications with less code than is usually needed. Quic is basically a preprocessor; it goes through your HTML file, looking for custom tags, and producing standard HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and pretty much anything) from such tags. When a custom tag is encountered Quic loads the appropriate assembly and locates a class with the same name as the tag. The class is then instantiated, and its Render method is called to emit the relevant codes and/or files. So we can say Quic allows you to delegate the dirty jobs to a class, and include that class in your HTML file as a custom tag.
